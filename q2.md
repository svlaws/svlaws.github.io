### 1. What is the problem you are trying to address?

### Case-1

Technology as such as an inaccessible entity to the ordinary population . such situation coupled with financial limitations leads to lack of basic of technology based startups . some families find it a waste of time and money and don't discover the values of such activities.This lack of supports from families is major problem. 
	
Indian culture predominately involves the notion of women being restricted from participating in technology based projects or even in technology as a field of interest and Lack of basic background of technology based startups, lack of Support from family, Less women participation, less knowledge to parents and faculties. Acted concepts about women by society, many of my friends are the predators of this problem, A major Well educated parents and faculties also giving mark some restrictions to do kind of activities. some tend to guide their children through the field of technology and projects related to technology. 

* Lack of startup background

* Lack of family support

* Women participations

* Technical education among parents

### Case-2

There is a profound limitation of knowledge in designing and programming language other than the core branch students(Mediclal, BA, B Sc, B Ed etc.) in existing society. Also, There is no regular backups, evaluation and documentation facilities. There is aslo a major handicap in program scheduling & utilization of FabLabs. In remote areas, Internet / technology is not an easily obtained service.

* Programs scheduling and utilization of in fab labs

* Inaccessibility of Internet, risk to conduct workshops and R&D labs(eg: Wayanad, Attappady etc.)

* Limitation of knowledge in programming & designing(Arts and science students)

* Lack of regular backups, evaluation and documentation about projects.

###Case-3

There is a lack of Technology museums in KSUM, Thus disabling the flourishing of technology startup culture.

* Technology museums.

###2. Why do you care about this problem and solutions?

###Case-1

Training for students from Kinder Garden onwards.along with their parents and faculty can be done. This may be done through "[CODE.ORG](https://code.org/)" programs. Faculty & parents up gradation is done via Arduino & Raspberry pi. Thus helps in the proper guidance of the students who may turn to be the future technology start up culture. also the parents promote their daughters to do participations of this kind of programs.

The provision of statement or honorarium to parents leads to attract and a spike in the students turning up for start up due to increased motivation from the side of parents thus induce mare and more parents & consequently more students to do their startups.

* [code.org](https://code.org/) programs from KG level,. For more click [here](https://code.org/)

* separate syllabus for parents and faculties

* Honorarium for parents.


###Case-2

Proper utilization of FabLabs done. This is implemented by dividing each months into four special weeks. Separate days for parents, faculties and for students for conducting workshops for them. by implementing this we can handle every one with out any traffic and in a proper time table. in each special week there is separate syllabus for conducting programs.
	
* Innovation week

* Designing week

* electronic week

* fabrication week

If KSUM have budget Plant a portable fast Internet device. through this we can contact programs and workshops in anywhere. also we can shift our workshops into scenic beauty places. Eg: Himalayan workshops.
	
By conveying the availability of GitHub application compulsory to do their documentations, ideas, regular backup and evaluation of their projects. which sustain life long by this can limit and stop discouraging and discontinuity of their activities in a huge level.

Create new syllabus and conduct special workshops for other than engineering students to attracted them. Provided advanced workshops for 2nd levels.

* special weeks

* portable Internet

* Documentation, evaluation through [Github](https://github.com/).

* special syllabus for other trade students.

###Case-3

Some space must be converted or reserved for reference technology museum. This museum provides on insight into dead skeleton of projects, business plans, history of startups, achievements, available opportunities , time lines, targets, library & material availability. such a technology museum aids in improving confidence in fresh startups, eliminate starting troubles and prevent duplication etc.

###3. Why do you believe you are best person suited to carry your project out?

Unity is strength, the more united we stand, the more successful we will be with a great team, a goal within deadline can be achieved. I may not be the best person. But the outcome will be the best with a good team and you. 

This may an assumption of total technology startups yearly. if approximated to below 10% of graduates.can be rocketed upwards approximate to a range of about 30% By training parents and faculties . such an involvement might enhance the annual female startup rate from 1% to about 10%. The chart shows the participation progress of students, graduates and girls with in 5 years.`

Gentle syllabus schedule for an year by weekly division of fab lab monthly scheduled enables proper utilization fab labs.

The presence of a visual aided technology museum presents an opportunity for fresh candidates for startups imbibe knowledge at a faster pace reducing chance of confusion. it also eliminate duplication & also provides clear ideas to the new startups.

Here we can see that a gain of 5.5% in inspiration rate and less in 2.5% in expiration rate. Net of 8% gain hike we can make every year.
