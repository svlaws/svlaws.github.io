In terms of technology , India has always fallen behind in the race to pinnacle . To bring India ahead we need to stop being a consumer and a developer . This might even erase poverty from the face of India. 

I was employed with a small time job which i resigned with no hesitation for the sake of development of technology and Kerala start up mission.I have dedicated my time for the same & had even joined to conduct workshops to promote startups with other fellows.

My commitment towards the society is not for showing off and I think even a random act of kindness can change lives. At our collage, which didn't have an NSS or any other organizations as such was changed when it was introduced was changed when it was introduced under my leadership.NSS organized several blood donation camps also put forth effort towards the environment day campaign and planted almost 500 sapling all around our campus. We also managed to design books for Mentally handicap children, half of the picture in those books were drawn by me. I was the Editor of our collage magazine 'Nizhalkoothu' which was one of the top 20 magazines listed out by malayala manoramma.

My friends & I had done a start up from the scratch without much financial backups or family support. Even though it fell apart, the overall venture proved that with more effort we could achieve success. Now, My friends & i have a plan to start a 'Malabar Maker Space' which would serve students in the Malabar area with full access to labs.There is also a plan to provide food to the needy & poor that includes collection of foods from feasts that prepare food in excess. Even a little bit counts and every bit helps.
