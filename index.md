'I' was not build in a day or a year . 'I' is the result of a process, that took decades process that took efforts of people innumerable and the innovation. Now Main Drives are his challenging insane, research affinity, the next was his some challenging insane friends and his PC, mobile phone and his loving fast Internet. 
	
	Listing out my motivations in a chronological order, Work experience and research done at FCRI during research training time has motivated 'I' even so more, The project was the mini calibration setup for the calibration and standardize the medical equipments. Techtop and Prefab training experience from the FabLAB and many motivated colleagues, applications of fab modules Going back, Being a Product design engineer(structure analysis) for seven months has inspired 'I'.
	
	Being a BTech mechanical engineer student, 'I' completed two projects ,SAE member, was NSS leader. 'I' spend hours on programmer and on incubation and startups. Not only all this inspired 'I'. My teachers were the prime focus of motivations.
	
	Higher secondary studies molded 'I'. Being a science students 'i' had a professional interest in projects and roles. Teachers fired up motivation in 'i' to become 'I'. When 'i' was at school he believed that the work experience, science fest, Olympiads,and exhibitions are the celebrated festivals in his life. Family places restrictions for many peoples for the lucky few like me , family is the most supportive part. My family understands my aspirations and with limited resources 
	
	'i' was made my home lacked the luxury that are would expert when looking at 'i' and in 'I'. there was no Internet or PC. All there was 'i' got was a lot of books and a lot of motivations . Thus,'I' was the butterfly that broke out of the cocoon 'i' made.
